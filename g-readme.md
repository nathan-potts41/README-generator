  NOTE: I have no idea what goes here yet...

  ## License
  MIT

  NOTE: The licenses for the application need to be selected from a list of options with a badge that is added near the top of the README. In addition, there needs to be a notice added to this section of the README that explains which license the application is covered under.

  QUESTION: What are the options for licenses anyway?
